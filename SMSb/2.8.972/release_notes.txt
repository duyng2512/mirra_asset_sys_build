  [2.8.748]
    Interactive Channels API
    ! ICAPI-698	[Interactive Channels API]
        Personalized devices and one-time password list receipt management is supported. It is now possible to see the list of personalized mobile devices and to unenroll a device or to disable an existing one-time password receipt.
        UPGRADE NOTES: It needs of AuthServer version 2.7.27 and higher
    % ICAPI-483	[Interactive Channels API]
        Generating and canceling codes for cash by code has been migrated to TransactionSwitch.
        UPGRADE NOTES: There is impact problem if CashByCode is already configured and working.
          The parameter cash_by_code_on_ts was added for backwards compatibility.
          If cash_by_code_on_ts=false then all CashByCode operations will work through the CustomerProfile as before.
          If cash_by_code_on_ts=true then all CashByCode operations will be performed via TransactionSwitch. In this case requires TransactionSwitch v1.1.202 or greater.
          By default cash_by_code_on_ts=true
    % I1702130185	[Interactive Channels API] [ICAPI-539]
        Now IC API is able to transfer "as is" error messages coming from an external system. 
        To define the set of response codes for which error messages should be transferred, use the new parameter "error_codes_with_custom_messages".
        UPGRADE NOTES: Error messages from external systems wan't be passed in the UI by default anymore. This change was made to prevent internal system error messages from being shown to the end user. Thus it is insecure.
          All error codes that should be shown to a client must be explicitly declared in the "error_codes_with_custom_messages" property. Also be aware that http response status for these errors has changed from code 500 to 400.
    % ICAPI-545	[Interactive Channels API]
        Added enrolment from various messengers (Facebook, Viber and Line).
        UPGRADE NOTES: AuthServer 2.7.17 and higher is required when using any of the messenger integration features (telegramIntegration, viberIntegration, lineIntegration, facebookIntegration).
    % ICAPI-587	[Interactive Channels API]
        Protection against brute force has been added for transfer by phone number.
        UPGRADE NOTES: If the transfer by phone number feature is present, the following parameters must be set:
          1. contract_by_phone_allowed_trying - the maximum allowed number of attempts to enter an invalid phone number (default value: 10).
          2. contract_by_phone_allowed_trying_period - period for counting attempts to enter an invalid phone number (default value: PT1H).
          3. contract_by_phone_locking_period - the blocking period if the number of attempts to enter the wrong phone number exceeds the value in the contract_by_phone_allowed_trying parameter (default value: PT1H).
          4. contract_by_phone_reset_after_success_trying - indicates the counter of failed attempts will be reset after the correct phone number has been entered (default value: true).
    % ICAPI-602	[Interactive Channels API]
        Transfer to bank client by card number can now be configured to show the beneficiary client's name.
        UPGRADE NOTES: Protection against brute force was extended to new resource.
          Therefore properties related to this protection have been renamed. 
          If the transfer by phone number feature is present, the following parameters must be renamed: 
          1. contract_by_phone_allowed_trying to incorrect_lookup_allowed_trying. 
          2. contract_by_phone_allowed_trying_period to incorrect_lookup_allowed_trying_period. 
          3. contract_by_phone_locking_period to incorrect_lookup_locking_period. 
          4. contract_by_phone_reset_after_success_trying to incorrect_lookup_reset_after_success_trying.
    % ICAPI-631	[Interactive Channels API]
        Added the ability to send events to cards if a client changes the language in Web Banking/Mobile Web Banking application.
        UPGRADE NOTES: Property login_notifications_concurrency_level to ows-application.properties file must be renamed to notifications_concurrency_level  if this property has existed. Set of transaction condition attributes is changed for MWB application. WEB attribute is removed, TBAPPL, MNET attributes are added.
    % I1707275654	[Interactive Channels API] [ICAPI-694]
        Mobile application version: OW-Client-Version header is now mandatory on session requests if the min_client_version parameter is set. If the header is empty and the parameter is set, an upgrade required error is generated. Thus all users with earlier versions of applications (earlier than 1.5.454 or earlier than 1.4.1121) can no longer use them without upgrade to the latest version.
        UPGRADE NOTES: Mobile application version: if the min_client_version parameter is set, be aware that all users with earlier versions of applications (earlier than 1.5.454 or earlier than 1.4.1121) can no longer use them without upgrade to the latest version.
    % ICAPI-761	[Interactive Channels API]
        Added visibility of contract number and operation description in pdf receipts for offline operations.
        UPGRADE NOTES: Translation for receipt_contract key should be added in server i18n files.
          This is required to support user-friendly history representation in pdf receipts generated for offline payments.
    # I1702225647	[Interactive Channels API] [ICAPI-546]
        Usage limiter switch "dateFrom" is filled correctly for Applications R1. Make sure the w4c_advapp_r2  parameter is set to the same value in both the CP Backend application and WB/MWB applications.
        UPGRADE NOTES: Make sure the w4c_advapp_r2  parameter is set to the same value in both the CP Backend application and WB/MWB applications.
    # ICAPI-838	[Interactive Channels API]
        Added a new status with the "expired" value.
        This status is returned for cash code operations when cash code is expired.
        UPGRADE NOTES: The historical entry status was FAILED when td_cons_doc.return_code is not zero and AUTH_RECORD.CREDIT_STATUS is 'C'.
          Now for such operation the status will be EXPIRED.
